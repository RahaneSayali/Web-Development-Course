    <!-- Responsive design is a way for a web developer to make a website adapt to all the devices and resolutions. 
    Endless new resolutions and devices are challenging to support separately for a web developer; therefore, responsive design is the best approach to develop a website that can adjust itself according to the screen size.

    Various Ways To Achieve Responsive Design :
By using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.

By using max-width/max-height.

Using CSS Media Queries.

Setting up the viewport.


em- 
Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element.

10em means ten times of the parent element.

rem-
Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.

In general, <html> is the root element.

In rem, "r" stands for "root."

vh- 
It stands for viewport height.

vh is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport height.

Example: Suppose height of the browser is 1000px, so 1vh is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.

vw-
It stands for viewport width.

Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport width.

Example: Suppose width of the browser is 1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.
